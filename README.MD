## Project Description

Welcome to our BusTrack App. This app allows users to search and book bus tickets conveniently. 
The app is built using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts, log in and log out securely. User passwords are encrypted for enhanced security.

- **Search:** Users can search for buses based on various criteria such as source, destination, date, and bus operator.

- **Seat Selection:** Users can view available seats on buses and select their preferred seats during the booking process.

- **Booking Management:** Users can view their booking history, cancel bookings, and receive booking confirmation emails.

- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment gateways are integrated to facilitate online payments for bookings.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly on desktops, tablets and mobile devices.
